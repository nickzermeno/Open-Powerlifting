# Open Powerlifting

This is a data science project that aims to explore the Open Powerlifting dataset and gain insights into powerlifting competitions and athletes. The project is built using R and various data science libraries, such as tidyverse, ggplot2, and dplyr.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to clone this repository to your local machine and install the required libraries.

### Prerequisites

The following are the prerequisites to run this project:

- R (version 4.0.0 or higher)
- RStudio (version 1.4.1717 or higher)

### Installing

To install the required libraries, you can run the following command:

```R
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "ggplot2", "dplyr"))
```

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Open Powerlifting dataset, which contains information about powerlifting competitions and athletes from around the world. The dataset consists of over 1.3 million rows and 37 columns, and is available for download on [OpenPowerlifting.org](https://openpowerlifting.org/data.html).

The dataset can be found in the `data` directory, and the data cleaning and preprocessing steps can be found in the `Data Cleaning.Rmd` R Markdown file.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory data analysis was performed on the dataset to gain insights into powerlifting competitions and athletes. The exploratory data analysis can be found in the `Exploratory Data Analysis.Rmd` R Markdown file.

## Machine Learning Models

Various statistical methods were used to predict house prices in Iowa. The methods used are:

- Linear Regression
- Forward Selection, Stepwise Selection, and Backward Selection
- Cramer's V

## Results

The results of the machine learning models and the exploratory data analysis are presented in the `OpenPowerliftingReport.pdf` report.

## Usage

To use this project, you can run the `open_powerlifting.R` script, which will load the dataset and perform the exploratory data analysis and machine learning modeling.
